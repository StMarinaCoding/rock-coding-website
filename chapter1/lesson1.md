# Chapter 1 — Getting Started with Python

Welcome to your first coding lesson!  
Before we write our first program, let’s talk about some basics.

---

## Programming Languages
A programming language is how humans “talk” to computers.  
Just like people have English, Spanish, or Arabic, computers have languages like **Python**, **Java**, and **C++**.  
Each language has its own rules, called **syntax**.

---

## What is Syntax?
**Syntax** is like grammar in English.  
If you don’t follow grammar, a sentence doesn’t make sense.  
If you don’t follow syntax, the computer will give you an error.

- Every programming language has different syntax rules.  
- In Python, lines are usually written one after another.  
- You can write many lines, and the computer will run them in order.

## Functions
A **function** is a small piece of code that does one job.  
- You give it a name.  
- You can “call” it when you need it.  
- Sometimes you give it information (called *arguments*), and it gives you something back.  

Example (don’t worry if this looks confusing yet):
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
````

Here, `def` starts the definition of a function called `greet`.
Inside it, we used `print` — a built-in function in Python.

---

## The `print` Function

`print` is one of the most important functions you’ll use in Python.
It tells the computer: **“Show this text as output on the screen.”**

Example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

When you run this program, you’ll see:

```
Hello, world!
```

---

## More Print Examples

You can print many things:

```python
print("My name is Sarah")
print(2 + 3)
print("The result is:", 2 + 3)
```

Output:

```
My name is Joseph
5
The result is: 5
```

Notice:

* You can write one `print` per line.
* Python runs them top to bottom.
* You can mix text and math in a single print statement.

---

## Summary

* Programming languages are how we communicate with computers.
* Syntax = the rules of the language.
* A function is a reusable block of code.
* `print` is a built-in function that shows output on the screen.
